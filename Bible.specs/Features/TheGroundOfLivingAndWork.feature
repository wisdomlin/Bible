Feature: 07 The Ground Of Living And Work

@mytag
Scenario: Live (inward motive)
The narrow gate deals not only with outward conduct but also with [inward motive]. 
The old man, the self, the flesh, the human concept, and the world with its glory are all excluded; 
only that [which corresponds with God's will] can enter in.
	When the kingdom people Live And Work
	Then inward motive is not the old man
	And inward motive is not the self
	And inward motive is not the flesh
	And inward motive is not the human concept
	And inward motive is not the world with its glory
	And inward motive is God's will 

@mytag
Scenario: Work (foundation)
Every one therefore who hears these words of Mine and does them shall be likened to 
a prudent man who built his house upon the rock.
Rock refer to Christ but to His wise word, the word that reveals the will of His Father who is in the heavens. 
The living and work of the kingdom people must [be founded on] the word of the new King 
for the accomplishing of the will of the heavenly Father. 
This is to enter in through [the narrow gate] and walk [the constricted way] that leads to life.
	When the kingdom people Live And Work
	Then foundation is God's will
	And  foundation is not the human concept
	And  foundation is not the natural ways
