@mytag
Scenario: 01 judge
The [kingdom people], living in a humble spirit under the heavenly ruling of the kingdom, always [judge themselves], not others.
	When the kingdom people judge
	Then the kingdom people always judge themselves

@mytag
Scenario: 02 give
2 Pet. 2:12 But these, like animals without reason, born natural for capture and destruction, 
reviling in things of which they are ignorant, will also in their corrupting of others be destroyed;
	Given others capture, destruct, and corrupt
	When the kingdom people give
	Then the kingdom people do not give the objective truth, nor the subjective experiences
