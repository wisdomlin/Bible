Scenario: 01 Blessed are the poor in spirit
We need to be poor, [emptied, unloaded] in our spirit so that we may [realize and possess] the kingdom of the heavens.
Spirit here refers not to the Spirit of God but to our human spirit, 
the deepest part of our being, the organ by which we contact God and realize spiritual things. 
This implies that the kingdom of the heavens is spiritual, not material.
	When the kingdom people are poor in spirit
	Then the kingdom of the heavens is the kingdom people's

If we mourn according to God and His economy, we will be comforted by being rewarded with the kingdom of the heavens. 
We will see God's heavenly ruling over the entire negative situation.
	When the kingdom people mourn
	Then they shall be comforted

If we are merciful to others, the Lord will give us mercy, especially at His judgment seat.

	Then they shall be shown mercy

	When the kingdom people are the pure in heart
	Then they shall see God

Scenario: 07 Blessed are the peacemakers
For the kingdom of the heavens, under its heavenly ruling, we must be those who make peace among men.

	Then they shall be called the sons of God
